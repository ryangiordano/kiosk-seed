# Kiosk Seed

This is a seed project for developing microsites for iPad using kiosk-pro.

### To get started with sass
npm install, then npm run to start the gulp process.  Write your .scss in the sass directory.  It is automatically compiled and placed in the css directory as a .css file.

#### skeleton.css
[skeleton.css]('http://getskeleton.com/') for super-lightweight responsive scaffolding, in case we need to update our kiosk to large format devices and screens.

#### jQuery
[jQuery]('https://jquery.com/'), jQuery-ui and jQuery-validate for form validation and UI effects like modals.

#### Green Sock
[Green Sock](https://greensock.com/) for creating complex and fast animations and UI interactions.

#### highcharts
[highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/docs) for use with our financial calculators.

### Illustrator Templates
In the "resources" folder.

### Fonts
[Online Font Converter](https://onlinefontconverter.com/) will take your font files, convert them to all the necessary formats (woff, ttf, svg, etc) and create a CSS file assigning them to font family for you.
