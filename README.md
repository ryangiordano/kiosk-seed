# Kiosk Seed

This is a seed project for developing microsites for iPad using kiosk-pro.

### Out of the box

#### skeleton.css
We use [skeleton.css]('http://getskeleton.com/') for super-lightweight responsive scaffolding, in case we need to update our kiosk to large format devices and screens.

#### jQuery
We use [jQuery]('https://jquery.com/'),jQuery-ui and jQuery-validate for form validation and UI effects like modals.

#### Green Sock
[Green Sock](https://greensock.com/) for creating complex and fast animations and UI interactions.

#### highcharts
[highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/docs) for use with our financial calculators.
